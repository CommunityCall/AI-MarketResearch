AI Market Research — Real‑Time Market Direction (overview)

AI Market Research is a TradingView extension that provides on‑chart directional estimates generated by machine learning models. The extension is designed to present model‑based short‑term direction indicators on TradingView charts to help users review algorithmic assessments alongside their own analysis.

This repository contains the extension’s integration and visualization code, configuration examples, and usage notes. The project is intended for informational and educational purposes only. See the Disclaimer section below.

Key features

Real‑time direction estimates — model‑based markers and overlays that indicate whether the model currently estimates upward, downward, or non‑directional movement for the selected symbol and timeframe. These are algorithmic estimates and should be treated as supplemental information.

Multi‑asset support — designed to work with symbols available on TradingView (examples include forex, crypto, equities, and commodities). Model parameters can be adjusted to account for different volatility profiles.

Configurable alerts — optional alerts that notify the user when signal conditions (as defined in settings) are met. Alert sensitivity and thresholds are configurable.

Transparency mode — optional display of internal confidence metrics and historical summary statistics to help users understand relative model behavior.

Integration friendly — lightweight visualization layer intended to integrate with TradingView-facing widgets and user workflows without heavy external dependencies.

Customizable settings — adjust forecast horizon, sensitivity, display style, and whether probability metrics are shown on the chart.

How it works (high level)

The extension processes live price data and derives short‑term direction estimates using trained models. Typical inputs include recent candle data, simple volume and volatility measures, and other market‑level features. Outputs are presented as chart overlays and optional numeric indicators.

This repository focuses on the integration, UI, and configuration. Model training, datasets, and evaluation notebooks (if provided) are included in the docs/ or notebooks/ directory — review them before attempting to retrain or redeploy models.

Installation & usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-market-research.git


Follow the instructions in INSTALL.md to build the TradingView‑compatible bundle.

Load the built extension into your TradingView environment according to TradingView’s accepted workflows.

Usage notes:

Enable the extension on a chart, select a symbol and timeframe, and adjust settings to suit your preferences.

Treat model outputs as supplemental information; combine them with your own analysis and risk controls.

Configuration (examples)

forecast_horizon: number of candles used for short‑term estimates (integer).

sensitivity: low | medium | high — controls how often signals are emitted.

show_confidence: true | false — toggle display of confidence metrics.

See config.example.json for a full list of options.
